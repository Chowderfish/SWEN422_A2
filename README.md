# SWEN422 HCI Assignment 2

## Expo & React Native
Project is being developed in React Native and using the Expo CLI.

1. Install NodeJS if not installed already.
2. Open a terminal/command line instance
3. Install Expo CLI with the following command `npm install expo-cli --global` (this comes with React Native)
4. Run `npm install` in the 'fling' directory.
5. Use `expo start` in the 'fling' directory to start the app.
6. View the app using the [Android / iOS Expo app](https://expo.io/tools) by scanning the QR code from the CLI. On iOS devices, scan the QR code using the camera app, and tap the prompt to open in Expo. On Android devices there is scan QR code feature inside the Expo app.


**Note: we have had some issues and unexpected variability between devices - the best experience is seen on iOS devices if possible**

To reload the app, allowing separate separate control modes to be chosen, shake the device (iOS) or swipe down (Android) and select the option "Reload JS Bundle"
